Full-stack web app I developed called CS Study Buddy Website a productivity tool designed to help students stay organized, focused, and on top of their academic tasks

Why I Built This:
As a computer science student myself, I found that juggling assignments, notes, and schedules often becomes overwhelming. This app was born out of that experience to provide a simple, centralized platform that helps students manage their:

📝 Todos & daily tasks
📌 Class notes
📆 Study schedules

💡 Key Features:

• Frontend: Built with React.js using modern hooks 
• Backend: Node.js with Express.js 
• Database: MySQL
• Full CRUD Support: Users can create, view, update, and delete their todos, notes, and schedules
• RESTful API architecture

🛠️ Still in Development:
This is just the beginning! I plan to enhance the app further with features like:

• User authentication & login
• Reminders & notifications
• Data syncing across devices
• Calendar integration
• Dark/light mode switch

More updates coming soon as I continue to develop this project!
